            <p>
              Our firm is a large investor in Bank of America common stock
              ("BAC") as a result of the sale of our family owned bank, Charter
              Bancshares, Inc. to NationsBank in 1996. As a result of our
              ownership in BAC, during 2009 we became active in working to
              change the corporate governance and culture of the company away
              from management's focus on size and market share towards a focus
              on risk - return tradeoffs and maximizing shareholder value.
            </p>
            <p>
              During 2009, we were successful (along with others) in causing
              shareholders to vote to separate the Chairman and CEO position at
              Bank of America. This was (and is the only) the first time that a
              company in the Standard & Poors 500 index had been forced by
              shareholders to separate the chairman and CEO position. (see WSJ
              story dated 4/30/2009) In addition, we were successful in
              generating significant "against" votes for three directors, each
              of whom resigned within months of the 2009 shareholder meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              During our shareholder campaign, we communicated with shareholders
              through Exempt Solicitation filings made with the Securities and
              Exchange Commission. Links to our filings with the Securities and
              Exchange Commission are set forth below. In addition, we utilized
              other methods of communicating with shareholders, including direct
              mail, interviews with various media, and television commercials in
              select markets.

              We continue to believe the responsible corporate governance is
              critical at both Bank of America and other large U.S.
              corporations.
